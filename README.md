# My Conda Base Environment

This is a base platform for building data science and machine learning projects. The intent is to provide a common platform for building and deploying data science projects. This process uses `conda` to manage the environment and `jupyter` to provide a web-based interface for interacting with the environment.

After the base `conda` environment is built you can then create other conda environments based off of the base with all of the extensions and packages that you need. This allows you to have a common base environment that is shared across all of your projects. This also allows you to have a common set of packages that are available to all of your projects. This is useful for things like `jupyter` extensions and `conda` packages that are used across multiple projects.
